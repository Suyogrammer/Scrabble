**Game Rules**


The game rule is taken from Scrabble Rules [(](https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules)<https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules>[).](https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules)


**Setup**


There are 100 tiles. They are placed in bag or scrambled face down on the table to serve as a pool of

tiles. Initially, each player draws seven tiles and places them on their tray. Human player goes first

followed by the computer player.


**Game Play**

The first player combines two or more of his/her letters to form a word and places it on the

board to read either across or down with one letter on the center square. Diagonal words are

not allowed.

Complete your turn by counting and announcing your score for that turn. Then draw as many

new letters as you played; always keep seven letters on your rack, as long as there are enough

tiles left in the bag.

Play passes to the left. The second player, and then each in turn, adds one or more letters to

those already played to form new words. All letters played on a turn must be placed in one row

across or down the board, to form at least one complete word. If, at the same time, they touch

other letters in adjacent rows, those must also form complete words, crossword fashion, with

all such letters. The player gets full credit for all words formed or modified on his/her turn.


New words may be formed by:

• Adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the board.

• Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board. The new word must use one of

the letters already on the board or must add a letter to it.

• Placing a complete word parallel to a word already played so that adjacent letters also form

complete words.



No tile may be shifted or replaced after it has been played and scored.

Blanks: The two blank tiles may be used as any letters. When playing a blank, you must state which

letter it represents. It remains that letter for the rest of the game.

If any word is unacceptable, then the entire play is unacceptable.

The game ends when all letters have been drawn and one player uses his or her last letter; or when all

possible plays have been made.


**Scoring**


The score value of each letter is indicated by a number. The score value of a blank is zero.

The score for each turn is the sum of the letter values in each word(s) formed or modified on that turn,

plus the additional points obtained from placing letters on Premium Squares.

Premium Letter Squares: A light blue square doubles the score of a letter placed on it; a dark blue

square triples the letter score.

Premium Word Squares: The score for an entire word is doubled when one of its letters is placed on a

pink square: it is tripled when one of its letters is placed on a red square. Include premiums for double

or triple letter values, if any, before doubling or tripling the word score. If a word is formed that covers

two premium word squares, the score is doubled and then re-doubled (4 times the letter count), or

tripled and then re-tripled (9 times the letter count). NOTE: the center square is a pink square, which

doubles the score for the first word.

Letter and word premiums count only on the turn in which they are played. On later turns, letters

already played on premium squares count at face value.

When a blank tile is played on a pink or red square, the value of the word is doubled or tripled, even

though the blank itself has no score value.

When two or more words are formed in the same play, each is scored. The common letter is counted

(with full premium value, if any) for each word.

BINGO! If you play seven tiles on a turn, it’s a Bingo. You score a premium of 50 points after totaling

your score for the turn.

Unplayed Letters: When the game ends, each player’s score is reduced by the sum of his or her

unplayed letters. In addition, if a player has used all of his or her letters, the sum of the other players’

unplayed letters is added to that player’s score.

The player with the highest final score wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest score

before adding or deducting unplayed letters wins.



**How to Play**


Before making the first move, first you need to select whether you want to play vertically or

horizontally(Vertical/Horizontal).

After choosing the Vertical/Horizontal option, click on the tiles you want to play.

Once you are done with the move, click on “Play” to get your word on the board. (Remember you need

to start by putting on letter in the middle)

You cannot undo once you have selected the word.

Please select one letter at a time.

If you can’t come up with a word. Simply click on “Can’t think. Pass Computer?” option and you can’t

give up first turn.

If you don’t want to play, simply Exit the game.



**Bug**


The game doesn’t run if you select Vertically and play a horizontal move and vice versa.

You need to know a word that’s in sowpods.txt or else it won’t work for any other dictionary.

You need to think properly before selecting the tiles as you cannot undo the tiles you selected.
